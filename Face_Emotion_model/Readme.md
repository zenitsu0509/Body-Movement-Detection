Holistic Body Language Detection with MediaPipe and Machine Learning
====================================================================

This project captures video from a webcam, detects human landmarks (face, hands, and pose) using the MediaPipe Holistic model, and predicts body language using a pre-trained machine learning model. The project provides real-time predictions on body language and visualizes the detected landmarks on the live video feed.


Overview
--------

This project combines **MediaPipe** for real-time holistic detection and a machine learning model for body language classification. It captures live video from the webcam, detects face, hand, and pose landmarks, and classifies the body language based on the extracted landmarks.

The key components of the project are:

-   **MediaPipe Holistic Model**: Detects landmarks for face, hands, and body pose.
-   **Pre-trained Machine Learning Model**: Predicts body language from the extracted landmarks.
-   **Live Visualization**: Visualizes the detected landmarks and displays the predicted class and probability in real-time on the webcam feed.

Features
--------

-   Real-time body language prediction using webcam input.
-   Detection of face, hands, and pose landmarks with MediaPipe.
-   Visualization of landmarks on the video feed.
-   Display of predicted body language class and probability.
